This is basically the only kind of art I can do but I enjoy doing it! I recreate sets of characters in super-low resolution pixel art.

These cover all sorts of media that I'm into, especially games and shows. Every year I also post a retrospective of the female characters I've played as in video games both on stream and offline.
