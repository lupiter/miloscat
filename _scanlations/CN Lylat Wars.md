A small project, this was a scanlation of a single page of the Club Nintendo (Germany) Lylat Wars [aka Star Fox 64] adaptation, published in 1997 in Special Edition 6. Club Nintendo was the name of Germany's official Nintendo magazine, and it had tons of fun original comics work in it.

The rest of this comic had been translated already and hosted at Arwing Landing. I noticed that one page was missing so had a quick go at it myself. I was still learning the skills of a scanlation editor at the time so it was good practice.

Sadly Arwing Landing has disappeared from the web, but I saved the scanlated comic files. So I put together a package of these files, with my contribution added in, plus a bunch of other Star Fox comics.
