Thanks to Number One Lufia Fan Sinrevi for scanning these pages from various Estpolis books and guides. I handled translation, editing, etc. Here we have some 3koma (3 panels as opposed to the usual 4), 4 of them relating to Estpolis Denki/Lufia & The Fortress of Doom and 6 for Estpolis Denki 2/Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals/Lufia. Remember, read these right to left!

Knowledge of the games probably helps and knowledge of Japanese culture and language is also useful for a couple of these: for example, knowing how strict they are with sorting waste is important for the gag with Lexis, and one joke is simply untranslatable due to a distinctly Japanese pun (so I sort of left it and explained it in a sidebar note). Also, the North American version of Lufia 1 has a stuffed pig item which in the Japanese version is a monkey.
