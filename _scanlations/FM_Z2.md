This one comes from a Famicom Manga pack-in booklet included with the May 1987 Ninensei edition of Shogakukan’s Shogaku Gakushu Zasshi magazines. The raw scans come from [Ragey;](https://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/ai/scans/) he also cleaned these up before I got to them! I took these and translated them into English with the help of Horseypope.

The comic is printed in a striking red-and-green two-colour style. It’s read Japanese-style, right-to-left, and was done by Shigeto Ikehara, who I know for his work on the Rockman manga in Comic Bombom. This shares his signature cute style, and looks great. It’s a sort of tutorial for the game Zelda 2, teaching you things about how to play it through a light choose-your-own-adventure/puzzle format. It’s pretty simple, as it’s aimed at 8-year-olds.
