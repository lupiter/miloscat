Thanks to [Ragey](https://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/index2.html) and his excellent scanning efforts I’ve found some fun video game comics from Japan. This comes from the Star Fox "Super Strategy Guide" guidebook included in a Dengeki magazine in 1993, I think; see the whole guide’s raw scans [here.](https://mega.nz/folder/nlJzxLIL#by212_z3nlqNoJazHL42BA/folder/z8R2QbYS) The comic is in full colour and read left-to-right, so very accessible for English readers. All I had to do was clean it up a bit and translate it to English, which I did with the help of Horseypope.

The comic is by Ayumi Konomichi, and although it’s short (2 parts of 4 pages each) it has some good gags and character-based jokes. I also included some illustrations from the guide that introduce the concept of polygons, and a 4koma strip from Famitsu that I also found recently, because why not? I included a few more-or-less direct quotes from Star Fox games in the translation where they would fit, see if you can spot them!
