Somebody once told me that Shrek had a manga adaptation, in the Jan 2002 issue of Corocoro Comic magazine. It was absolute rock star [Ragey,](https://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/ai/scans/index.html) who scanned and cleaned this short chapter by Takeshi Tamai. Since I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shed, I said “yep, what a concept” and decided to translate it into English with the help of shooting star Horseypope.

“Kattobi! Shrek: Monstā-kyū no Nyū Hīrō”, or “Here Comes Shrek! The Monstrous New Hero” is a 20-page bit of silliness that purports to adapt the plot of Shrek but actually portrays it pretty differently; so, as the final page says, it’s a different experience to watching the movie. After all, we could all use a little change. It’s read in right-to-left format and I’ve left the original sound effects in (but subtitled them) to maintain the integrity of the art, because that’s the way I like it.

So bundle up, hope you don’t get bored, and enjoy the silly gags of the Shrek manga. There’s so much to see (like a bonus colour 4-koma after the main story). Hey now!
