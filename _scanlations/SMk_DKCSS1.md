This is a brief one-shot from the pages of Super Mario-kun by Yukio Sawada, based on Donkey Kong Country but not really retelling the game. Rather, it’s the story of Mario and Yoshi crashing their plane into Donkey Kong’s territory on New Year’s Eve. They then have to find the missing banana hoard (again), which is in the possession of a Rockkroc. It’s silly (to be expected of this manga) but a bit of fun, and a rare friendly interaction between the Kongs and Mario.

This story was presented as a "special stage" or bonus chapter outside the regular chapter structure, and was printed in Volume 12 of the collected manga. I translated this mostly by myself but had Horseypope's help to refine the English script.
