This is a Mario’s Picross-themed comic from the official German Nintendo Magazine, Club Nintendo, printed in issues 4 and 5, 1995. I say Picross-themed, but it just borrows the vague setting of the game without any reference to picrossing. I did the translation, editing, etc. myself.

So Mario’s taking a turn as a pop archeologist: robbing tombs, desecrating important cultural sites, offending the locals. As someone in the comic points out, he fancies himself the Indiana Jones type but he’s really just in it for personal gain. It’s kinda reprehensible but I’m pleased to once again see Mario not as the good guy.
