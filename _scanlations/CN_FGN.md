A classic Mario-centric comic from the good people at Club Nintendo Germany, originally printed in 1998 issue 3. It's supposed to be a promotion for the Game Boy Camera, although it features a demonic one sold to Mario by a fortune-telling Luigi which causes all sorts of hijinks including some scatological misfortune. How they thought this would sell the product I don't know...

I did the translation and editing for this one myself.
