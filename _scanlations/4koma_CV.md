For various Castlevania releases, Konami hosted a handful of gag comics on the games' official sites. Most of them were done by Shizumon, who has a recognisable simple art style and mustard-coloured backgrounds, but a few were done by other artists.

[12 of the 19 gag strips for Order of Ecclesia](http://www.vgmuseum.com/mrp/cv-ooe/ooe-comic.htm#translated) and [all 18 for Dracula X Chronicles](http://www.vgmuseum.com/mrp/cv-rob/tdxc-comic.htm#translated) were officially translated to English for the US websites of those games. But there were many, many more that never left Japan. I wanted to read these funny joke comics, so I took it upon myself to translate them!

The covered games are:  
-Order of Ecclesia (7 by me, 12 by Konami US)  
-Dracula X Chronicles (18 by Konami US)  
-Lords of Shadow: Mirror of Fate (2 strips)  
-Judgment (9 strips)  
-Lament of Innocence (3 Shizumon strips, 3 other)  
-Dawn of Sorrow (8 Shizumon strips, 6 other)  
-Portrait of Ruin (10 Shizumon strips, 8 other)  
-Harmony of Despair (11 strips)  
-Curse of Darkness (11 strips)  
-Pachislot Akumajō Dracula (6 strips)  
-Pachislot Akumajō Dracula III (5 strips)
