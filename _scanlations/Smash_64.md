Published in the February 1999 issue of Monthly Corocoro Comic—the 250th issue overall—this one-shot promotes the release of Super Smash Bros. 64, aka Nintendo All-Stars: Dairantō Smash Brothers. It was written and illustrated by Hirokazu Hikawa, who is best known for the Corocoro manga Kirby of the Stars: The Story of Dedede Who Lives in Pupupu.

Joining their Kirby in this adventure are Mario, Donkey Kong, and Pikachu, who cross paths with the others from the base roster of Smash 64 in the Toy Kingdom as Link tries to teach them a lesson about friendship. There's plenty of gags in this short 20-page manga, as well as a few cultural references that I've tried to explain in the margins.

Health issues have made it difficult for me to do scanlations for a while, but I'm hopeful I'll be able to do some more following this project. This time, I'm proud to have done all the translation myself (with a little help from some friends) plus all the usual editing etc… I did my best but there may be mistakes! What I'm not proud about is the quality of the scans, which were provided to me anonymously and aren't great, but it's better than nothing!

Of course, after completing my scanlation I discovered that while I'd been sitting on my scans, Baxter of [Tsundoku Diving](https://www.tsundokudiving.com/) had completed his own scanlation of this one-shot, and he did an excellent job too! I'm still going to publish mine anyway but check out Baxter and his other projects, his Smash translation is also at the Mangadex link below.
