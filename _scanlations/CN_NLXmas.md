On the occasion of Kerstmis (as the Dutch call it), here’s two short comics from the Dutch edition of Club Nintendo magazine. This version of Nintendo’s official magazine shared a lot of content with other European editions. In fact after translating the first image I realised that it was already printed in the UK edition, but what the heck, here it is anyway. I’m pretty sure the second image has not been available in English before, though!

Thanks to Geoffrey de Vlugt for uploading the magazine scans here, and to my friend Dangermouse for some translation assistance.
