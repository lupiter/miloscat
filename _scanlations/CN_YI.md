This is a Yoshi's Island "adaptation" comic published in the very first special edition supplement to Club Nintendo, Germany's official Nintendo magazine, in 1995. Its purpose seems mainly focused on being a primer for gameplay mechanics, although obviously with a lot of chatter and humorous moments.

You may notice if you’ve ever played Island that the Chatterbox that plays the role of secondary character who advises Yoshi spouts some blatant lies about game mechanics. You can’t grab floating coins with your tongue, and coloured eggs won’t just break on a wall and release items! So don’t listen to them all the time.

Caramelman translated part of this for me, and I struggled through the rest with some tips from Supper Mario Broth. SirCathyWise painted the credits page art. This is the revised package with extra pages that I found in an alternate scam.
