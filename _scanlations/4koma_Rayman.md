A quick scanlation of a Rayman-themed 4koma, commemorating the release of Rayman 2 in Japan. From the pages of the May 2002 edition of Monthly Corocoro magazine. Written and illustrated by Hori Yoshikazu (this romanisation for 掘美一 is a guess as this mangaka is fairly unknown, with few works to their name). Scanned by [Ragey.](https://randomhoohaas.flyingomelette.com/ai/scans/corocoro.html#4koma) Horseypope helped me translate it, I did the rest.

What a novelty to get a Rayman comic. Apart from some Rabbids-only ones later, the only other comic I know about is [the 4-page short in Disney Adventures.](https://raymanpc.com/wiki/en/Hands_Down!) Hopefully more will surface some day.
