A short manga by Shinji Hikino, now scanlated into English!

One of my previous scanlation projects was [a Famicom Manga pack-in from Shogakukan by Shigeto Ikehara.](https://miloscat.com/scanlations/FM_Z2.html) This is its predecessor, based on The Legend of Zelda (The Hyrule Fantasy). Included in a booklet with the July 1986 Ninensei edition of Shogakukan’s Shogaku Gakushu Zasshi magazines, this 16 page manga by Shinji Hikino is half comic story and half strategy guide, summarising the events of the game with a bunch of tips and tricks thrown in. Unlike the followup, this one has only the barest hint of puzzle/choose your own adventure mechanics.

The art is nice, with a blue/red colour scheme and some cute character designs. It’s to be read Japanese style, right-to-left. [The scans were provided to me by Melora of History of Hyrule,](http://historyofhyrule.blogspot.com/2022/04/first-time-ever-online-incredibly-rare.html) along with a translation by Aquamentus. I edited that translation into the images so that it is readable in English! Special thanks to Sorcerian Bootleg who had started on their own scanlation, and allowed me to use [their excellent title page edit](https://twitter.com/DS5_Bootleg/status/1533124398802255882) in this release.
