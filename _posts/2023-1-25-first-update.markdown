My new site is now live! I wanted a more permanent home for my scanlations of old video game comics, one that's more browsable and stable than them living in social media posts.

So this website will be the hub for links to all my projects but especially the home base for my translated comics. All of my comics now have sub-pages in the Scanlations area, which then link to where the images are hosted. I'll still post to social media when I do a new one but it will point back here.

Huge thanks to SirCathyWise for doing so much work to put this together and make it easy for me to maintain.
